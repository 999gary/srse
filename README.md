Stick Ranger Save Editor, requires an 18.9 copy of the game, works with vanilla and most mods.
You can get a vanilla copy of the game with [this.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/453336416416694274/510204964803444746/Vanilla_Downloader.zip) Then place the "Stick Ranger Modded.js" and data folder into the same folder as the editor's "index.html", the js file must be named "Stick Ranger Modded.js". Feel free to comment on how bad the code is or something.
